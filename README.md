# Just Warp Go

A [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)-inspired desktop terminal management app built with **Wails v2 + Go + Vue 3 + TypeScript**.

Manage workspaces, run multi-tab terminals (local PTY & SSH), and track file changes — all with a beautiful GUI. **No Git required.**

## Features

### Workspace Management
- Select local folders or connect to remote servers via SSH
- Automatic `.gitignore`-aware file scanning
- Binary / noise directory skipping
- Recently-opened workspace history

### Terminal
- Multi-tab terminal with local PTY and SSH support
- xterm.js-based terminal emulator
- One-click SSH terminals from saved configurations
- Per-tab CWD tracking, sessions persist across tab switches

### File Change Tracking
- Real-time filesystem monitoring via fsnotify
- Snapshot-based change detection (no Git dependency)
- Diff view with line-level additions/deletions
- **Accept All** / **Revert All** for bulk operations
- **Accept File** / **Revert File** for single-file operations

### Remote Workspace (SSH + SFTP)
- Connect to remote servers and browse the filesystem
- File change tracking via fingerprint comparison (size + mod time)
- Read remote file diffs on demand

### Quality of Life
- Startup commands — auto-run CLI tools on terminal launch
- SSH config management — save and reuse connection profiles
- File tree browsing with click-to-open
- Code preview with syntax highlighting
